Description: This package is an algorithm that takes a person's input (their name) selects the first letter and then converts the letter to an asking number.
Then correlates the asking number with names from the data set and then randomly generates a south african name.
The South African names from the table were collected from http://babynames.allparenting.com/babynames/Ideas/South_African_Baby_Names_and_Meanings_Boys_and_Girls/ , which is a list of common baby names within South Africa.
